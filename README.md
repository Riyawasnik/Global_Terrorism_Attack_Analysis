# Global Terrorism Attack Analysis
Introduction
The primary goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and build a Random Forest Classification model on the Global Terrorism Dataset to predict the type of terrorist attacks.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains global terrorism data and is considered big data due to its extensive coverage. Given the size of the dataset and the files involved, we have utilized Git Large File Storage (LFS) to efficiently manage and version large files.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial step in understanding the characteristics and patterns present in the dataset. Through EDA, we aim to gain insights into various aspects of global terrorist attacks, including trends, distributions, correlations, and outliers.

Random Forest Classification Model
We employ the Random Forest Classification algorithm to build a predictive model for determining the type of terrorist attacks. By training the model on historical data from the Global Terrorism Dataset, we aim to accurately classify future incidents based on their attributes and characteristics.

Repository Structure
data/: This directory contains the dataset used for analysis. Large files are managed using Git LFS.
